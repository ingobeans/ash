shoe: a shell!

probably cross platform, though i'm yet to check.

i really just wanted a basic replacement to the built-in shells in windows, as cmd can be really dumb and powershell can be really frustrating (and slow as hell on old machines).

i'm adding the features i find necessary, and attempting to make it look pretty!
